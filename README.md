## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and links to my projects.
I have put all my working knowledge of everything I know together and put all my work on display work ranging from HTML to PostgresSQL


## Optimizations
I'm not finished with some projects but will go back to finish and polish up everything I can.

## Lessons Learned:
I'm still learning more and more each day but this is a opportunity to put my work up and display what I know and can do.


## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
